# Authentication Flow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stuck "Signing you in..." State
**Problem**: After successful Google OAuth login, users would get stuck on the "Signing you in..." screen and need to manually refresh the page to proceed.

**Root Cause**: The auth callback page was redirecting to home before the SupabaseProvider properly updated the user state, causing the home page to redirect back to login.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling and state management in callback page
- Added delay after profile creation to ensure data is saved
- Improved loading states and user feedback

### 2. Navigation Refresh Required
**Problem**: When users navigated away from the site and returned, they needed to refresh the page to load properly.

**Root Cause**: Issues with session refresh timing in middleware and improper handling of authentication state changes.

**Solution**:
- Simplified middleware logic to avoid complex session refresh
- Improved SupabaseProvider initialization and state management
- Added proper loading states in all pages

## Files Modified

### `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Added delay after profile creation
- Improved loading state management

### `src/components/SupabaseProvider.tsx`
- Enhanced auth state initialization
- Improved profile fetching timing
- Added better error handling for network issues
- Increased timeout for auth operations

### `src/middleware.ts`
- Simplified session refresh logic
- Improved cookie handling
- Better route protection logic

### `src/app/page.tsx`
- Added loading state to useSupabase destructuring
- Improved loading state handling
- Prevented premature redirects

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: All authentication operations now have proper error handling with user-friendly messages.

2. **Improved Timing**: Added strategic delays to ensure data consistency between authentication steps.

3. **Enhanced Loading States**: Better loading indicators throughout the authentication flow.

4. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex session refresh logic that was causing timing issues.

5. **Consistent State Management**: Ensured authentication state is properly synchronized across all components.

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Login Flow Test**:
   - Go to login page
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Should redirect to callback and then home without getting stuck

2. **Navigation Test**:
   - Login successfully
   - Navigate to a class
   - Navigate away from the site (open another tab)
   - Return to the site
   - Should load properly without requiring refresh

3. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Try logging in with invalid credentials
   - Should show proper error messages
   - Should allow retrying the login process

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing persistent auth state in localStorage for better UX
- Add retry mechanisms for failed network requests
- Implement proper logout functionality with state cleanup
